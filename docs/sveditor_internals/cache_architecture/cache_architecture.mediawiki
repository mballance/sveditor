= Cache Architecture =
SVEditor uses a file-backed cache for the AST produced by file parsing. 

== Backing-Cache File Structure ==
The backing cache is composed of a series of formatted files containing AST data. A minimal 
filesystem structure is imposed on these formatted files.

Each backing file has a maximum size, and expands by a pre-defined amount when more storage is 
required. By default, the maximum file size is 100MB, and the expansion size is 1MB.

The storage within a backing file is divided into 4K blocks. There are several block types:
* Root Block
* Directory-Entry Block
* File-Data Block
* Bitmap Block

| Magic || 8 || Magic number for the root block
