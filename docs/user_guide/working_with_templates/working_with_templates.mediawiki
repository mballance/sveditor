= Working with Templates =

SVEditor provides the template facility to enable files -- often specific to a 
verification methodology -- to be quickly parameterized and generated by the user. 

SVEditor provides built-in templates for common constructs specific to 
verification methodologies, such as a UVM Agent. Users can easily create
new templates that are specific to their design and verification environments.

== Instantiating Existing Templates ==
Existing templates are instantiated using the New SystemVerilog Template wizard. 
Open the wizard by selecting the project or folder in which template files
should be created, then select New->SystemVerilog Template from the context
menu, as shown below.

=== Selecting the Template ===
Locate the desired template in the Available Templates list, as shown
below. Then select Next.

=== Specifying the Template Name ===
All template instances require a name to be specified. Usually, this name is used
to specialize the name of files created by the template. Specify the template 
name, as shown below. Here, we are creating a UVM Agent where all file and
class names are prefixed with ''simple''.

Note that the wizard confirms that the files to be created will not overwrite
existing files in the output folder. Select ''Overwrite Files'' if you wish
to overwrite existing files.

Finally, select Next.

=== Specifying Template Parameters ===
Some templates have additional parameters. These parameters are configured
on the Template Parameters wizard page.

After configuring the parameters, select Finish.


== Setting the Template Path ==

SVEditor discovers user-defined templates via the template path. To configure
the template path, open the preference dialog (Window->Preferences). Select the SVEditor->SV Template Paths entry, as shown below

== Creating a New Template ==

A template is composed of a template descriptor and template source files. 

=== Creating an SV Template Descriptor File ===
An SV Template descriptor (.svt file) is created via a wizard. Since many users will
not create their own templates, the SVT wizard is not available via a shortcut. 

Select the project or folder in which you wish to create the template descriptor. 
Select New->Other... from the content menu, as shown below. Select Next.

Expand the SVEditor category and select SystemVerilog Template Descriptor, as shown below.
Select Next.

Finally, specify the name of the template-descriptor file as shown below. Select Finish.

The template descriptor editor will open, as shown below.
